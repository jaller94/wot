# WoT WG/ETSI ISG CIM Simple Liaison for NGSI-LD
The purpose of this liaison 
will be to gain a better understanding of our respective activities
and look for opportunities to work together. 


## ETSI ISG Context Information Management
As part of its mission, the ETSI Industry Specification Group on cross-cutting Context Information Management (ISG CIM) drives the specification of an Application Programming Interface Specification/API, named NGSI-LD, which aims to enable applications to discover, access, update and manage data and context information from many different sources making it the interface of choice for getting access to Digital Twins data and managing their capabilities. 

## Purpose 
The goal of the liaison is to evaluate the potential of using W3C WoT Things Models for the description of  NGSI-LD entity types as well as specifying how default WoT Things Descriptions can be derived from WoT Things Models using the NGSI-LD API as the form to interact with Things.

## Participants
The liaison proposal has emerged from informal discussion between W3C WoT and ETSI ISG CIM representatives.

**Contacts from W3C WoT are:**
* Kaz Ashimura - W3C - WoT WG Staff Contact
* Michael McCool - Intel - WoT WG co-Chair

* Juanjo Hierro - Freelance - Chair of FIWARE TSC


## Scope 
What work needs to be done, by whom?

## Deliverables 
The following have been discussed but have not been formally agreed to.
* NGSI-LD API Binding Document as W3C Note describing how default WoT Things Descriptions are derived from a WoT Things Models using NGSI-LD as form to interact with Things
* ETSI GR-055 on service execution to include the use of WoT ThingsDescription for NGSI-LD models description

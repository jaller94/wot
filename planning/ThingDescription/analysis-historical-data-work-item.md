# [DRAFT] Analysis of Historical Data Work Item

This document gathers all information related to time series or historical data-related topics.
These include issues, use cases, and discussions in other forms.
This document will be worked on before extending the TD specification.

## Overall Description of the Topic

Some edge and cloud services can collect property value changes or event emissions for a certain time.
This data, called time series, can be collected by Consumers to display (or use in any other way) the evolution of the affordance data over time.

This topic is also known as:

- Time series
- Data Trend

## Use Cases

To find the related use cases, the [coverage document](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/coverage.csv) has been used and another pass through the [use cases document](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases) has been made.

- [Historical Property Updates](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/302#issuecomment-441235444)

## Other Discussions

These can be artifacts like presentations, meeting minutes.

## Identified Requirements

From the use cases, requirements should be identified.

## Feature Proposals

Ideally, the feature can exist only after the requirements are identified. However, if there are proposals already, they can be put here to drive discussions.

# TD.Next Testing and Tooling Work Items

## Linting
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/linting)

Linting rules exist for programming languages or for API specifications in order to establish custom rules within projects. 
How these rules can be defined for TDs is not specified in any way, making it difficult to constrain flexibility of TDs in a standardized manner. 
The WG will define the mechanism for linting TDs together with optional rules that can be used by different projects.

## Testing Procedure
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Testing)

Currently it is at Eclipse Thingweb Playground at <https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/playground/tree/master/packages/assertions> but we should move it here.

## Bugfixes
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/bug)

Small updates for the TD next. Actual bugs for 1.1 should be handled as errata

## Examples Reorganization

It would be better to have complete TD examples that can be validated but at the same time we can show a part of it for specific features.
Also, see <https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/1851>.

## Spec Generation
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Tooling)

Single source of truth for specification generation.

- Reducing the amount of documents that we need to maintain.
- Make sure there are no gaps in the tooling and process for building index.html

# Architecture
Summary of main points from discussion.

## [Sept 15 Minutes](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/15-wot-minutes.html#t05)
- Review of issues with current approach, discuss possible solutions
- Current document has multiple objectives, overlap with other docs
- Should clarify objective and focus doc on that
- Functions as first-contact "explainer" doc, one primary objective
- Could improve doc to better fill that goal, move unnecessary context elsewhere
     - Detailed use cases and requirements (and usage patterns) to "Use Cases and Requirements" doc
     - Assertions about TD can be moved to TD doc
     - etc.
- Security difficult but some of the specific items could go to other docs
- Suggest we try to reorg and focus doc *before* making informative/normative decision

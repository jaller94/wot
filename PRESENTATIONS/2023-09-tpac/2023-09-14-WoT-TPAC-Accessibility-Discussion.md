# Accessibility
Summary of main points from discussion.

## [Minutes from Joint WoT/APA Session Sept 14](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/14-apa-minutes.html#t11)
- Added Accessibility Considerations sections to WoT docs
- APA Research Question TF has some use cases
- Need to narrow to what WoT can do within its scope
     - Don't currently attempt to constrain UIs, etc.
     - Doesn't have to be normative work in WG, can consider exploratory work in IG
- Example exploratory activity: generation of ontologies, e.g. for accessibility annotations
     - WoT does not define, but TDs provide a location for metadata
     - Can use annotation to provide properties of physical interface
- Existing work with voice in browser and multimedia groups
     - Best practices
- Profiles for accessibility
- Applications of AI (e.g. LLMs) to IoT
     - Microsoft/Siemens have looked into using LLMs to generate TDs
     - Could also generate connectors for other services, e.g. voice agents
     - Also recent major improvements to speech I/O
- Use case example
     - Portable HVAC/air flow management
     - Sharing preferences in a portable manner
  
Follow Up:
1. Document Use Cases
    - Will be restarting WoT Use Cases meetings soon
    - Should capture accessibility use cases and requirements
2. Exploratory Topics
    - As part of WoT IG, can also do in WoT CG
    - A project to define an accessibility ontology would be useful, need to recruit people interested

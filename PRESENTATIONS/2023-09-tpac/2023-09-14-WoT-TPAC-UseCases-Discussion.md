# Use Cases and Requirements
Summary of main points from discussion.

## [Sept 14, General Status and Process](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/14-wot-minutes.html#t07)
- [Slides](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/main/PRESENTATIONS/2023-09-tpac/2023-09-14-WoT-TPAC-UseCases-McCool.pdf)
- Use of categories as intermediate step between use cases and requirements
     - General idea is to group use cases of a like kind with similar requirements, e.g. "Manage PII"
     - Tweaks to diagram to capture many-to-one relationships e.g. between work items and features, requirements and categories, etc.
     - Some "horizontal" use cases may be categories, e.g. "Cloud Integration"
- Security
     - Discussed more later
     - But, special, security requirements relate to risk mitigation, threats only apply to some use cases, etc.
- Discovery
     - More typical set of requirements
     - Have already created a small set of requirements we can update
     - Current text needs updating, actually only really mentions the one requirement we did not satisfy (queries)
- Process
     - In each TF, and as group
     - Should keep simple, avoid touching existing use cases
     - Should restart use case meetings

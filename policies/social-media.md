# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
Social Media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.) news requires quick publication. Thus, group resolutions would be too slow and a policy is required.

However, a group resolution is required if a new platform is to be adopted or a significant change to the use of an existing platform.

## Social Media
- Chairs can review a proposed post and either authorize it immediately or ask for a 24-hour member review (via email).
- Chairs can also post immediately for urgent, fact-based announcements. In addition, Ege Korkan has been approved to post such tweets directly.
- However, such "immediate posts" should be limited to statements of objective facts.
- "Chair review" is mostly to determine the category of post: a statement of fact that can be posted immediately, or if not in this category, something that needs member review.
- Because any chair can review, this can be done in any meeting that a chair is present at or via email.
- Review should be done whenever there is the slightest doubt; another set of eyes can help make sure there are no ambiguities or unintended meanings.

### Content
- Posts should be in English (for now, to keep things simple).
- The WoT accounts owned by the W3C WoT IG/WG can promote content from other groups or people that are related to WoT. The restrictions are:
  - The link to the content itself has to be inserted. This can be a calendar entry, blog post, original tweet, or post.
  - The owner should be indicated in the message (tweet, post, etc.) itself. For example, this can be saying "... from WoT CG", or "... from Node.js Summit 22".
  - If we are sharing content that is from the same platform, a rendering of the original content generally happens and the two requirements above are generally automatically met. For example, on Twitter/X, a retweet links to the content and shows the owner of the content.
  - The relationship to WoT should be clear from the promoted content. For example, if someone who usually talks about WoT also tweets about their vacation, we should not share it.
  - Valid examples of promoted content:
    - Check out the event from WoT CG: https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/322db7e4-1a9f-44c6-8ddf-af601043dfb9
    - Retweeting https://twitter.com/relucri/status/1642937903939567635
  - Invalid examples of promoted content:
    - Check out this WoT event: https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/322db7e4-1a9f-44c6-8ddf-af601043dfb9. (The owner is not clear from the text)
    - MyOrganization does very advanced development of WoT. (The original content is not there and is biased)

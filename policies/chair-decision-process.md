# Web of Things (WoT) Policy

The following policy is only valid for the Chairs' meeting. 

## Working Group Chairs' Decision Process and Quorum
- The following relates only to decisions that the Working Group agrees can be delegated to chairs, which includes the following:
    - Rejecting unsolicited Invited Expert applications
- Chairs' decisions will generally by consensus of all three chairs, two chairs if only two are attending the meeting (see below), with the team contacts' assistance if necessary.
- Weekly meetings will be held prior to main WoT Working Group call.
- Quorum is 2 out of 3 chairs.  If only one chair can attend* the Chairs' meeting no decisions can be made, although some administrative work may take place (preparing agendas for the main call, etc).
- However, if possible when a chair can not attend a meeting, the discussion should be summarized and communicated to the absent chair and they be given one week to provide their opinion.
- A chair not attending the Chairs' meeting (who has not commented by email) will generally be considered to be abstaining. 
- If a chair cannot attend* a Chairs' meeting but clearly states their opinion/decision on an issue via email prior to the meeting this input will be considered as being equivalent to in-person discussion, but only for that specific topic, which needs to be clearly stated in an email to all chair and the team contact.
- Regarding the meaning of "attend": It is acceptable for a chair to state their opinion on a topic via IRC only if they cannot log into the real-time video/audio conference for some reason.  Both forms of "live" communication are considered "attendance" at the meeting.

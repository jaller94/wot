# Web of Things (WoT) Policy

The following policy is only valid for the Chairs' meeting. 

## Working Group Chairs' Decision Process and Quorum
- The following relates only to decisions that the Working Group agrees can be delegated to chairs, which includes the following:
    - Rejecting unsolicited Invited Expert applications
- Chairs' decisions will generally by consensus of all three chairs, with the team contacts' assistance if necessary.
- Weekly meetings will be held just prior (no more than a day earlier) to main WoT Working Group call
- If the chairs cannot meet consensus on a decision, and a decision needs to be made immediately, a majority vote (2/3) process will be used.
- Consistent with the above, quorum is 2 out of 3 chairs.  If only one chair can attend* the Chairs' meeting no decisions can be made, although some administrative work may take place (preparing agendas for the main call, etc).
- A chair not attending the Chairs' meeting (who has not commented by email) will generally be considered to be abstaining from voting.  Consistent with the above, if only two chairs are present in a Chairs' meeting and cannot agree on a decision, it will have to be deferred until the third chair can join.
- If a chair cannot attend* a Chairs' meeting but clearly states their decision on an issue via email prior to the meeting this input will be considered as being equivalent to in-person voting, but only for that specific topic, which needs to be clearly stated in an email to all chair and the team contact.
- Regarding the meaning of "attend": It is acceptable for a chair to state their opinion on a topic via IRC only if they cannot log into the real-time video/audio conference for some reason.  Both forms of "live" communication are considered "attendance" at the meeting.

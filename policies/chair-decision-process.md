# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
## Chairs' Decision Process and Quorum
- The following relates only to decisions that the WG agrees can be delegated to chairs, which includes the following:
    - TBD, ex. rejecting unsolicited IE applications
- Chairs' decisions will generally by consensus of all three chairs
- Weekly meetings will be held just prior to main WoT working group call
- If the chairs cannot meet consensus on a decision, and a decision needs to be made immediately, a majority vote (2/3) process will be used.
- Consistent with the above, quorum is 2 out of 3 chairs.  If only one chair can attend* the chairs' meeting no decisions can be made, although some administrative work may take place (preparing agendas for the main call, etc).
- A chair not attending a meeting (who has not commented by email) will generally be considered to be abstaining from voting.  Consistent with the above, if only two chairs are present in a meeting and cannot agree on a decision, it will have to be deferred until the third chair can join.
- If a chair cannot attend* a meeting but clearly states their decision on an issue via email prior to the meeting this input will be considered as being equivalent to in-person voting, but only for that specific topic, which needs to be clearly stated in an email to all chair and the team contact.
- Regarding the meaning of "attend": It is acceptable for a chair to state their opinion on a topic via IRC only if they cannot log into the real-time video/audio conference for some reason.  Both forms of "live" communication are considered "attendance" at the meeting.

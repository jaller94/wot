# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
Note: The following is in the (draft) WoT charter, so this policy will be active when
the charter is approved and can only be changed by modifying the charter.  It is included here 
only for information and for clarification of certain points.

## Group Decisions
The basic policy is provided in the working group WoT charter (see [Section 8](https://www.w3.org/2023/10/wot-wg-2023.html#decisions)).

### Clarifications
However, the following interpretations are to be included in this policy as clarifications:
- "Working Days" will be defined as Monday through Friday, ignoring holidays
    - Holidays are not consistent between international locales, and taking the union of all holidays by all participants would create too much complication and delay, so we will adopt the simpler policy of ignoring them.
    - In practice 5 working days is one week for review and 10 working days is two weeks.
- For both "Advance" calls for resolutions announced, created and distributed the same day as a WoT main call, and resolutions "tentatively" agreed upon in a WoT main call, the entire day will be considered as being available for review.
    - This allows for a resolution to take place in a WoT main call one to two weeks after an "advance" call for resolution made the same day as a WoT main call.
    - For "tentative" resolutions proposed and made in a WoT main call, they can be closed (confirmed as full resolutions) one to two weeks later in the next WoT main call.  If there is no objection after the review period such resolutions will be considered confirmed at the close of the corresponding WoT main call.
- If not otherwise stated by a Chair or by a policy, the default review period will be 5 working days.

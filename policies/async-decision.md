# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
This is a policy to make the review process for specification changes more efficient by using asynchronous tools, rather than following the current unwritten rule that pull requests can only be merged following a resolution in a synchronous weekly conference call.
The scope of this policy is limited to individual deliverables where the editors are the editors of the deliverable in scope.

This policy was originally [submitted](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-wg/2021Aug/0006.html) to the public-wot-wg mailing list on 3rd August 2021 and followed up by @benfrancis at https://github.com/w3c/wot/pull/1005/files.
This version extends it by taking the reviews into account, while moving the problem and notes into an Appendix section.

## Asynchronous Decisions for Deliverables

### Overall Idea

We use GitHub's built-in [code review tools](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) to formally review pull requests without having to wait for a decision in a synchronous weekly call.
This form of asynchronous decision process specifies how to conduct asynchronous decisions that are already written in the Working Group's existing [Decision Policy](https://www.w3.org/2020/01/wot-wg-charter.html#decisions).

### Issues and Pull Requests

The rules below apply to the two subsequent sections:

- An Issue should be created before a Pull Request that links to it is created.  This Issue should be used to reach a consensus before creating a Pull Request if possible.  This discussion can include whether the change needs to be normative or not.
    - Note: A template for Issues should be created that prompts for useful information, e.g. a link to a Use Case and/or Requirement; to be discussed.
    - Note: A template for PRs should be created that prompts for a link to the related issue and a proposed category: Editorial or Normative
- Editors should label Pull Requests as being either "Editorial" (non-normative) or "Normative" as soon as possible.
- At least one week should be allowed for discussion after the label has been applied before merging a Pull Request.
- If any Working Group member disagrees with an "Editorial" classification, a Pull Request should be reclassified as "Normative"

### Editorial (Non-normative) Changes

- For changes labeled as Editorial (which make non-normative changes to the wording of a specification or its supporting documents), a code review approval from a single Editor of the specification is sufficient to merge a Pull Request, if there are no objections or calls for discussion from any Working Group member (including other Editors) on the Pull Request.

### Normative Changes

- In the following, the Editor's decisions should reflect their understanding of the consensus of the group.
- For Normative (breaking changes or new features to a specification), approval is required by at least two Editors of a specification who are not from the same organization or who are Invited Experts. Editors should use GitHub's code review tool to either:
  - Approve the Pull Request. The approval should be clear and if there are any further changes needed, they should be requested to the pull request (see below) or a separate issue should be opened.
  - Request changes to the Pull Request, explained in a comment.
  - Comment to say that they have no strong opinion or that they abstain, deferring to the opinion of other editors.
- A pull request can be landed once two editors have provided their approval.  However, if any editor objects then the Pull Request should be rejected.
- Editors are expected to provide formal reviews, but all members (and non-members) may contribute to the public discussion on GitHub and Editors are responsible for determining consensus. Reviews may be requested from other interested members in order to ascertain consensus.
- If there are requests for changes from other Working Group members, they should be taken into account.
- If a consensus can not be reached by the editors asynchronously where the Pull Request discussion thread goes long (see appendix) without making progress, then a synchronous discussion in a web conference is needed to arrive at a consensus. The need for a synchronous discussion should be indicated in the discussion and the results should be reflected as a GitHub comment. If a unanimous decision can not be reached by the members of the Working Group involved in the discussion, then Chairs may call for a group decision to resolve a deadlock in line with the Working Group's existing [Decision Policy](https://www.w3.org/2020/01/wot-wg-charter.html#decisions).
- For all changes, those who start a Pull Request or Discussion/Issue implicitly agree beforehand to join a synchronous meeting in case the TF moderator identifies a long and inconclusive discussion and calls for a meeting.

## Appendix

### How to identify long and inconclusive discussion

A one-size-fits-all solution to identify a long and inconclusive is not realistic. In the end, it is the editors' responsibility to identify such cases. 
Some metrics that the editors can use are listed below:

1. **Number of Comments**: A long and complex discussion often involves multiple participants sharing their thoughts and opinions. Look for a high number of comments on the PR. You can see the comment count on the Pull Request page.

2. **Comment Depth**: Check if the comments have nested replies. This indicates that the discussion has branched off into sub-conversations, making it more complex.

3. **Comment Length**: Lengthy comments often suggest a detailed and in-depth discussion. Look for comments that span multiple paragraphs or contain extensive explanations.

4. **Time Span**: If the discussion has been ongoing for a significant period, it might indicate complexity. A Pull Request with a long and complex discussion is likely to have active comments spanning days, weeks, or even months.

5. **Emotion and Tone**: Complex discussions can sometimes involve emotional or heated exchanges. Look for strong language, disagreements, or differing opinions expressed in the comments.

5. **Reviewers' Involvement**: If multiple reviewers are actively engaged in the discussion, it suggests a complex review process. This involvement can be seen through their comments, requests for changes, or approval/disapproval of the Pull Request.

### Problem

Currently:
1. It is common to get to the end of a two-hour meeting without having managed to review all of the open pull requests in a given repository
2. If anyone is missing from the call who may have feedback, the discussion is often deferred for a week or more until they are available to join a call
3. When pull requests are reviewed there isn't always a clear resolution about whether or not to merge and discussion can end up being paused until the following week
4. Sometimes only small changes are needed to a pull request before landing it, but it has to wait another week for a chance for another review

### Notes

Note that the advantage of version control is that decisions need not be final. It is easy to revert a change or modify it with a follow-up commit. There are also plenty of opportunities to provide feedback on changes after they have landed, through the various stages of W3C publication.

This process would further be aided by:
1. Descriptive commit messages and pull request titles, ideally referencing an issue number that a patch relates to
2. Configuring a simple template for pull requests where authors can select whether they consider the change to be normative/breaking or non-normative/editorial and therefore which level of review they are requesting

More efficient asynchronous working practices may also eventually allow for a reduction in the number of W3C WoT meetings conducted each week, which currently total around twelve hours a week.
